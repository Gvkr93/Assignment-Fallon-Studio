## Decentralization Rationale, In 3â€“4 sentences, explain why decentralization is important for modern platforms.

Decentralization is important for modern platforms as it removes dependency on a single controlling authority reducing the risk of censorship, data manipulation and system failures. By distributing data over a large network, it increases security & transparency. This structure encourages trust among users, as validations are handled collectively rather than by a central authority. Additionally, decentralization enables fairer participation in digital ecosystems, especially in areas like finance, crowdfunding and prize draws.
